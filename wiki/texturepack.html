        <h1>Create a Minecraft Texture Pack</h1>
        <p>Do you want to learn how to create a Minecraft texture pack? This GitHub repository will teach you everything! Texture packs were introduced in version <code>1.6.1</code> and have been supported in every version of Minecraft since. The key thing to understand is that every Minecraft version is different. For example, texture packs from before <code>1.9</code> have a different structure compared to modern texture packs. This tutorial will focus on texture packs for versions <code>1.9 - 1.21.5</code>.</p>

        <h2>What will you need to create a texture pack?</h2>
        <p>To create a texture pack, you won’t need to download anything, as Windows provides everything required to make a good texture pack. However, if you want to edit blocks professionally, have better organization, or simply prefer easier access to files, I recommend using free software:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Microsoft Visual Studio 2022</a> – To edit code, view the full structure, and modify blocks.</li>
            <li><a href="#">Paint.NET</a> – To add and edit visual elements.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Both of these programs are safe and available on Windows.</p>
